A curated list of relatively simple-to-use privacy resources for those who do not want to be spied on by techbros and AIs

# My personal recommendation list (the quick & dirty list of ways to escape enshittified apps that are spying on you)

This is what I recommend as a starting checklist for when you get a new device. Most of these apps are available for both desktop and mobile, with some obvious exceptions. 

- Stop Windows 10 & 11 from spying on you: O&O Shutup 10++ https://dl5.oo-software.com/files/ooshutup10/OOSU10.exe
- Watch Youtube without ads or tracking: Freetube https://freetubeapp.io/#download
- Notes application that doesn't let Google spy on you or lock you out of your own stuff: Joplin https://joplinapp.org/help/install/ or Standard Notes https://standardnotes.com/download/windows. Tiddlywiki https://tiddlywiki.com/ is also great but you will have to do your own backups. 
- Best media player: VLC https://www.videolan.org/vlc/
- Web browser: Firefox  https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ (install the uBlock Origin, Disconnect, and Decentraleyes add-ons)
- Super-paranoid anti-tracking web browser: Brave https://brave.com/ (you will have to disable some crypto nonsense after installing, but the browser itself is legit)
- Alternate choice for anti-tracking web browser: Mullvad Browser https://mullvad.net/en/browser
- Search engine that doesn't track you: Startpage https://startpage.com/ (https://duckduckgo.com/ is also good but put `-ai` at the end of your searches)
- Password Manager that is more secure than LastPass: KeePass2 https://keepass.info/download.html or Proton Pass (https://proton.me/pass)
- Best VPNs: Proton VPN https://protonvpn.com/, AirVPN https://airvpn.org/, Mullvad VPN https://mullvad.net/en/vpn
- Cloud Storage that doesn't spy on you: Proton Drive https://proton.me/drive or Tresorit https://tresorit.com/
- Calendar that doesn't spy on you: Proton Calendar https://proton.me/calendar
- Office applications that don't cost money and don't spy on you: LibreOffice https://www.libreoffice.org/
- File Sync between devices you own: SyncThing https://syncthing.net/
- Email that doesn't feed your info to an advertising algorithm: Proton Mail https://proton.me/mail
- End-to-end encrypted text/chat: Signal https://signal.org
- Download Android apps without a Google account: Aurora Store https://auroraoss.com/ and F-Droid https://f-droid.org/

# How to not be spied on by your cell phone

If you want to be fully, Dale Gribble paranoid level of safe from your phone spying on you, you're going to need to install **GrapheneOS** https://grapheneos.org/

GrapheneOS will remove ALL Google spying from the phone, but still let you use Android apps (acquired from F-Droid and/or Aurora Store so Google doesn't know who you are). I've found all of the apps I recommend on this list to work on GrapheneOS. 

The main issue is that GrapheneOS only works on unlocked Google Pixel phones, so you have to buy an unlocked phone directly instead of getting a phone as part of a plan from your carrier. The Google Pixel 8a is IMO the best low-cost option: https://store.google.com/product/pixel_8a?hl=en-US

The nice thing about the Google Pixel 8 and 9 series phones is that they will still be up-to-date for 7 years. The Pixel 8a, 9, and 9 Pro will all be up-to-date until 2031. The 8 and 8 Pro will stay up-to-date until 2030. If you don't like spending a lot of money on a phone, the Pixel 8a is the best deal. 

**If you can't afford to, or don't want to, change phones right now, the next best option is to use the apps I listed above, and don't use any Google/Apple/Microsoft services that you don't need to. Apple is still a little bit more trustworthy but you have to pay attention to what Apple encrypts and what it doesn't. If you're using an Apple device, make sure to enable Advanced Data Protection.**

Unfortunately downgrading to a dumbphone isn't a perfect solution, because big tech can still read your text messages. Android or iPhone with Signal and Proton Mail/Calendar/etc is still significantly better than most other options.
